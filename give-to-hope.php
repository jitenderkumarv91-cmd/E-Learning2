        <h2>Starting from Zero is Okay</h2>
        <p>
            Every coder starts from zero. No one is born knowing HTML,
            CSS, or programming logic. If you are new to coding, confused,
            or afraid, remember this is a normal part of learning.
            What matters is your decision to start.

    <!-- Motivation for confused students -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Feeling Confused or Demotivated?</h2>
        <p>
            Many students feel lost when they see too many technologies,
            career options, and advice from different people.
            You are not alone. Confusion means you care about your future.
            Take one small step, learn one topic at a time, and move forward.

        <h2>Skills Matter More Than Degree</h2>
        <p>
            In the world of technology, your skills speak louder than
            your degree. Companies look for what you can build, solve,
            and understand. With strong coding skills and practice,
            anyone can grow in this field.
